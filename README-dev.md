# How to use in development mode

**Mac Developers**: Install Xcode command line tools if you don't already have them. 

**Windows Developers**: Install Node.js globally, may also have to run Spearmint in admin mode. 

// as of January 2023
// works through node version 19.4.0
// electron-devtools-vendor must be at version 1.1 for now due to a bug
// react must be version 17 due to a dependency for mui
// fix-path must be version 3.0.0 due to 4.0.0 only being usable with an import statement which is not supported in electron.jsx

// @capacitor/screen-reader did not seem to be implemented in any way, but could be good to implement now
// or for a future iteration team to implement re: accessibility testing

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Install node version 16.13: ```nvm install 16.13```
3. Use node version 16.13: ```nvm use 16.13```
4. ```npm install```
5. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project
6. Insert the following lines of code into the .env file
    ```
    APP_DEV=true
    BROWSER=non
    SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
    MONGO_LINK=
    ```
7. Set MONGO_LINK to your MongoDB URI (ex: mongodb://localhost:27017)
8. Make sure your MongoDB is running if it's hosted locally. 
9. ```npm run rebuild``` (different from `npm rebuild` so please pay attention to that)
10. ```npm run dev```

# Tips for development mode

- To enable hot-module reloading, uncomment line 24 in the Electron.js file.
        ```// require('electron-reloader')(module);```
- To enable dev tools, uncomment line 72 in the Electron.js file:
        ```// mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();```


# Suggestions if you would like contriubute: 
1. Exporting test files in TypeScript: the tests currently export in JS. 
2. Convert codebase to TypeScript: currently, there are some files in TS, and others in JS. It would be great to convert all to TS.  
3. Dry refactoring of codebase: A lot of the folders and files for the frontend frameworks testing are the same, and the codebase would GREATLY benefit from refactoring and modularizing those. 
4. Persist user data: there is currently sign up and login functionality, including OAuth. However, V0.12.0 commented it out because there is currently no user data being persisted. A great feature would be to save tests to work on them later, or create templates for each user. 
5. A known issue/bug is some erratic behavior with the terminal. A more detailed issue will be opened for this. 
6. Add more customization to the tests themseleves such as chaining expects, add the ability to use siblings and children, etc., or having the ability to test more than one component in one test file.
7. Try to fix the dependencies issues. Currently we have to run on node version 16.13 for the app to work. But if the packages incompatiblites are fixed that would be wonderful! 

Or please feel free to add any other features or fixes that you would like or are interested in. 



# Build and Run image on Docker

## Pre-requisites 
- Mongo: Mongodb is used for authentication functionality. If you didn't use locally hosted mongodb URI in .env file, you may skip to the X server section. 

    1. Add `172.17.0.1` and `0.0.0.0` to the network interfaces of mongo config file.

        a. Open `mongod.cfg` (Usually located in C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin)

            # network interfaces
            net:
              port: 27017
              bindIp: 127.0.0.1, 172.17.0.1, 0.0.0.0

     2. Run mongo on port 27017

- X server

    1. Download and run either [X410](https://x410.dev/) or [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)

        * For X410, use the following configuration

        ![x410 with display = 0](/public/x410.png)

        * For VcXsrv: change the display number to 0, for other settings, use default. 

        ![VcXsrv with display = 0](/public/VcXsrv.png)


## Running the image 
After running the mongo on port 27017 and running the x server with display number of 0, follow the steps below. 

1. Build the docker image by running the following command

    `docker build -t [image name] .`

2. Run the docker image by using the following command: 

    `docker run -e DISPLAY='host.docker.internal:0.0' -it -v [directory of project to be tested]:/[directory to create volume] [image name]`

    - `-e DISPLAY='host.docker.internal:0.0'`: Set environment variable ‘display’ to host.docker.internal:0.0 

    - `-it`: Run container as interactive

    - `-v`: Creates a volume and mounts the testing application into the container. (ex: `-v [testing files]:[created volume]`)

    *Please note that once the spearmint container is running, you can only access the folders that you mounted here.`  qGHP\
*Please note that the image uses root user, as shown in the Dockerfile.
